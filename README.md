Painting with Bitmaps is a two-day workshop exploring programmatic composition techniques using digital images as a source material. We will start by looking different strategies and algorithms that artists use in their work. We will learn to how access pixels that are stored in a computerâ€™s memory and play with a few different techniques for generating new imagery. Students will spend some time adapting algorithms (pixel sorting, masking, pixel-to-vector transformations) and writing their own. The workshop will be taught using Processing (http://www.processing.org) and participants are expected to have some experience with Processing or other creative coding frameworks.
